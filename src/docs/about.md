Grab your smartphone and get Geocaching over the summer
holidays with our geocache challenge. Geocaching is a
fantastic way to enjoy the outdoors exploring new areas and
keeping fit.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
We have hidden over 100 codes around Witham, get out there and start
searching for the hidden caches. These are blue, and red
coloured cable ties that could be fixed to street furniture,
trees, fences, signposts - just about anywhere! Using your smartphone,
our web-app, and what3words or Google Maps. Navigate,
find and validate any number of geocaches.

Find the cache, enter the five-digit code from the cable tie
into the web-app and see where you are on the score

Anyone is welcome to take part, it's not just for Scouts or
young people. Adult supervision may be needed dependant on the
age of the young person and parental/guardian discretion should
be used.
</p>
<p>
The background behind Geocaching is to find (using GPS) small
hidden items in the urban or rural environment hidden by a
Geocacher. We have simplified this for this summer activity to
ensure it's available to all. The only equipment required to
take part is the use of a smartphone or tablet with a 4G data
connection.
</p>
<p>
There is no need to sign up or log in and no personal information
is supplied from you to the organisers (and no personal
information will be requested from this web-app). 
We use the information provided by your device to generate a unique Device ID which is used to allow you to track your <a href="foundCaches" data-navigo="true">found caches</a> and see your position on the <a href="leaderboard" data-navigo="true">leaderboard</a>. 
We only store the Device ID and found caches (cache ID and timestamp when found). No personally identifiable information is stored.
Please refer to our
<a href="privacy" data-navigo="true">Privacy Policy</a> for more

<h2>Who are we and why have we made this challenge</h2>
<p>
We are Beaver and Explorer Scout leaders based in Witham and
wanted something extra for the young people of Witham to do over
the summer holidays, the GeoScout project has been solely created by
us for use in Witham over this summer holiday. Caches will be
collected from the week beginning 11th of September 2023.
