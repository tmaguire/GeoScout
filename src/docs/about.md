Grab your smartphone and get Geocaching over the summer
holidays with our geocache challenge. Geocaching is a
fantastic way to enjoy the outdoors exploring new areas and
keeping fit.
</strong>
</p>
<p>
We have hidden 100 codes around Witham, get out there and start
searching for the hidden caches. These are blue, and red
coloured cable ties that could be fixed to street furniture,
trees, fences, signposts - just about anywhere! Using your smartphone,
our web-app, and what3words or Google Maps. Navigate,
find and validate any number of geocaches.

Find the cache, enter the five-digit code from the cable tie
into the web-app and see where you are on the score

<p>
Anyone is welcome to take part, it's not just for Scouts or
young people. Adult supervision may be needed dependant on the
age of the young person and parental/guardian discretion should
be used.
</p>
<p>
The background behind Geocaching is to find using GPS small
hidden items in the urban or rural environment hidden by a
Geocacher. We have simplified this for this summer activity to
ensure its available to all. The only equipment requirement to
take part is the use of a smartphone or tablet with 4G data
connection.
</p>
<p>
There is no sign up or log in needed and no personal information
is supplied from you to the organisers and no personal
information will be requested from this web-app. We only
hold very little information about the device used to verify the
caches found by the finder. Please refer to our
<a href="privacy" data-navigo>Privacy Policy</a> for more
information.

<h2>Who are we and why have we made this challenge</h2>
<p>
We are Beaver and Explorer Scout leaders based in Witham and
wanted something extra for the young people of Witham to do over
the summer holidays, the GeoScout project has been solely created by
us for use in Witham over this summer holiday. Caches will be
collected the week 12th of September 2022.
